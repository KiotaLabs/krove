A graphical view of some of the important work done in the domain of general purpose problem solving. This visualization serves a dual purpose. On one hand it allows you to start with a broad bird's eye view of the topics of interest. On the other hand, it points to the original publications that introduced those topics to ensure that your literature review stays accurate.
